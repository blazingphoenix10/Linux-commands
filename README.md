## diff

Following is a linux command to look at differences between 2 files, 
helps a lot when you want to compare two different versions of a file

```
diff file1.txt file2.txt
```
It shows the changes that need to be made in file 1 to become file 2.
Or put another way, it shows the differences between file 1 and file 2, with respect to file 1. 

The format in which it shows the difference is as follows: >File1LineNumber{add (a),change (c), delete(d)}File2LineNumber
Eg: 1a2, means add line number two from file 2 after file 1 

## grep and grepl

grep returns indices of occurences of PATTERN in TEXT:
  ```r
    grep("virus", c("coronavirus", "rhinovirus", "cyanobacteria")
  ```

grepl indicates whether PATTERN occurs in TEXT as a logical vector
```r
  grepl("virus", c("coronavirus", "rhinovirus", "cyanobacteria")
```
